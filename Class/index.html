      <pre>
        Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
        <ol>
          <li>Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)</li>
          <li>Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
          </li>
        </ol>

<p>TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</p>
<p>HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2</p>
<p>HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰</p>
